    The Community Service Project is an initiative undertaken by the students of Nimra College of Engineering and Technology
    as a part of their academic curriculum and social responsibility. The project aims to promote environmental awareness,
    social responsibility, and community engagement among students.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project was carried out over a period of five weeks in nearby villages and educational institutions. The activities
    included tree plantation drives, village cleanliness and waste management programs, helping the underprivileged,
    conducting awareness programs in schools and colleges, and learning about different plant species in nurseries.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this Community Service Project, students developed leadership qualities, teamwork, communication skills, and a
    sense of responsibility towards society. The project reflects the institution’s commitment to holistic education and
    sustainable development.
